# Project Goal
Do a snowflake schema from a star schema based on postcard products


## Star schema
A star schema is a multi-dimensional data model used to organize data in a database so that it is easy to understand and analyze. 
Star schemas can be applied to data warehouses, databases, data marts, and other tools. 
The star schema design is optimized for querying large data sets.

## Snowflake schema
A snowflake schema is a multi-dimensional data model that is an extension of a star schema, where dimension tables are broken down into subdimensions. 
Snowflake schemas are commonly used for business intelligence and reporting in OLAP data warehouses, data marts, and relational databases.
